 # This program is a lightweight version TensorFlow, with the same functionality:

 # It never works, and instead outputs a random error.
 
 Tensorflow is terrible. It's impossible to install and use, and it outputs many, many errors before it actually works. I thought, why not make a lighter weight version of Tensorflow, but with only the errors and no functionality? It's practically the same thing!

To run:
import ErrorFlow as ef
