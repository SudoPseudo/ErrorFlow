 # This program is a lightweight version TensorFlow, with the same functionality:

 # It never works, and instead outputs a random error.
 
 Tensorflow outputs many, many errors before it actually works. I thought, why not make a lighter weight version of Tensorflow, but with only the errors and no functionality? 
 
 This lightweight version of Tensorflow saves hundreds of megabytes in storage space, and cuts down on needless uses of processing power.  It is faster, smaller, and more effective than the original Tensorflow.
 
 ErrorFlow an be used by typing the command:
 
import ErrorFlow as ef
